Hey, I'm Nova.

I use the GNU operating system with the Linux kernel.

I love libre software and only use proprietary garbage if there's no alternative that suites my needs.
The term "open-source" is stupid and problematical, as one of the founders of the OSI was a sexist and homophobe racist.

If you're one of the people bashing rms, go frck yourself!
